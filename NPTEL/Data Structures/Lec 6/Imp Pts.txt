1. Proof of #leaf nodes <= 1 + #int nodes(By PMI):-
=> for last step of induction:-
-> rec used the induction hypo for left and right sub tree and summed up to get the res for entire tree
-> For instance, let k be the int nodes and m be the unt node in left sub tree
-> thus int nodes in right sub tree = k-m-1 (one deducted of the root node)
-> for left subtree:-
. # leaf nodes <= 1 + #int nodes of left sub tree(=m)
-> sim for right sub tree: #leaf nodes <= 1 + k-m-1
-> total leaf nodes = #leaf nodes(left) + #leaf nodes(right)
			  <= (m+1) + k-m = k+1
