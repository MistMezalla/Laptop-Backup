=> For a (free) tree (also applicable for rooted trees):-
-> #edges = #vertices - 1	

=> For a graph to be connected:-
-> min(#edges) = #vertices - 1; case for a tree(graph with no cycle)

=> Suppose there is a graph with #vertices = n and #edges = n-k; then #connected components =?
-> k if no cycles in the connnected compo
-> >k if there are cycles in the connected compo
