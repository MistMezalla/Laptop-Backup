=> For alpha = n/m; unsuccessful search : O(1+alpha)
			  successful search   : O(1+alpha)
-> Since hashing is done in unordered storage fashion; every new elem is added to the end of the linked list in case of chaining lest avoid 
duplicate key entry.
->Hence in order to find an elem successfully; num of searches made = num searhces while inserting + 1(for succesful elem found)
											  = num of unsuccesful searches made(as elem is not present)[eqv to case 
											    of ins elem] + 1
