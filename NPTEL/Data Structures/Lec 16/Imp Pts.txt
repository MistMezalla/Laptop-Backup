-> Only root node is stored on main memeory
-> Rest all levels(and nodes corresponding to them are stored on disc(sec mem)) where;
. Each node is kept on the pg of the disc

-> Degree in case of B tree is the out degree of a node.

=> Disadv of one pass ins and del:-
-> If the insetrion and del are interspersed then when the root node is full say after del and followed by ins op then root node will split
   and agn del occurs then root node will merge.
-> Hence the abv 2 states will keep toggling if the ins and del ops are interspersed and not in blocks.

=> one sol over abv prob is to use 2 pass with a tradeoff with main mem
-> i.e. store the nodes traversed so far(# <= height of tree) in main mem to make the changes to them while passing up; without explicity
   writing onto a page twice.
