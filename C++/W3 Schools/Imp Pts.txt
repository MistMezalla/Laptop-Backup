->The error in method1 code arises from the fact that the Vehicle class is inherited by the Car class using protected 
inheritance. This means that the public and protected members of the Vehicle class become protected members of the Car 
class. As a result, they are not accessible directly from an instance of Car.

->Hence see method2 which makes use of encapsulation concept to acces the parent(Vehicle) class attributes to the child(Car) class.

-> printf(%.2f) for example can be implemented via the means of
cout << fixed << setprecision(2) : in this case the parameter is giv as 2

* Destuctors in OOPS:-
-> counter ana of Constructors
-> syntax:
~<class name>
{
//block code of destructor if any
}
-> practical example:(implicit call)
when an obj is defined with a scope then after funtion comes out of the scope the 'desturctor' is called 'implicitly' to del that obj 
instance
-> destructors are typically called implicitly when an object goes out of scope or when it's explicitly deleted. However, it's rare and 
generally not recommended to explicitly call destructors yourself, as it can lead to undefined behavior or resource leaks if not done 
properly.
-> exmple (or syntax) for explicit call:
MyClass obj;  // Constructor called
obj.~MyClass();  // Destructor called explicitly
